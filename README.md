In this case the player wins the round and the player's money increases by the amount that was bet.
The dealer comes closer to 71/2 than the player, or the player busts.
In this case the player loses the round and the player's money decreases by the amount that was bet.
Both, the player and dealer bust.
In this case the player loses the round and the player's money decreases by the amount that was bet.
